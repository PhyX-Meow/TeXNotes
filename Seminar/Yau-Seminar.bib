	abstract = {This is the second edition of the now definitive text on partial differential equations ({PDE}). It offers a comprehensive survey of modern techniques in the theoretical study of {PDE} with particular emphasis on nonlinear equations. Its wide scope and clear exposition make it a great text for a graduate course in {PDE}. For this edition, the author has made numerous changes, including a new chapter on nonlinear wave equations, more than 80 new exercises, several new sections, a significantly expanded bibliography.  About the First Edition: I have used this book for both regular {PDE} and topics courses. It has a wonderful combination of insight and technical detail...Evans' book is evidence of his mastering of the field and the clarity of presentation (Luis Caffarelli, University of Texas) It is fun to teach from Evans' book. It explains many of the essential ideas and techniques of partial differential equations ...Every graduate student in analysis should read it. (David Jerison, {MIT}) I use Partial Differential Equations to prepare my students for their Topic exam, which is a requirement before starting working on their dissertation. The book provides an excellent account of {PDE}'s ...I am very happy with the preparation it provides my students. (Carlos Kenig, University of Chicago) Evans' book has already attained the status of a classic. It is a clear choice for students just learning the subject, as well as for experts who wish to broaden their knowledge ...An outstanding reference for many aspects of the field.
