\section{Introduction}
In this paper, we aim to prove 
\begin{theorem}
  Let \(\Omega\) be a smooth mean convex region in \(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\) whose boundary \(\partial\Omega\) has at
  least two components. Then on every boundary component, the mean curvature \(|H|\) does not have a positive
  lower bound.
\end{theorem}
